L-Touch is a TouchDesigner module for controlling L-ISA objects as well as many other parameters in L-ISA Controller via OSC.
More information on specific parameters, and the python extensions, can be found in the pdf documentation.

To get started:
  1. Create a new Base COMP
  2. Drag the .tox file into the External TOX parameter
  3. Reinit the network
  4. Under the LTouch parameters page, pulse the Load Python parameter

The LTouch parent folder can be moved anywhere, but the .tox file and other child folders must stay together for the module to work properly.
